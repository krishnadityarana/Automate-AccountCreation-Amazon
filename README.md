# Automate-AccountCreation-Amazon
The primary focus of this repository is to automate the account creation process on Amazon. Throughout the development, I have followed the OOP/Page Object Model concept, which promotes code modularity and maintainability. Please note that during the experimentation phase, I used false information to safeguard personal data.
